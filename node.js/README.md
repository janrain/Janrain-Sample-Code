Example usage of auth widget with call to auth_info api with resulting token from Node.js.

There's a minimal web page `index.html` with the `<script>` tag and `<div>` for a embedded auth widget - you'll need to set the name of your application in the JavaScript - or you can copy the JavaScript tag into a page of your own.  Also, you'll need your API key, set in `rpx.js` here.
